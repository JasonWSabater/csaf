# The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Sandbox
The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) sandbox provides a collaborative environment for the community to propose and develop experimental capabilities in the CSAF specification. The CSAF sandbox will allow the community to fully investigate and implement new capabilities before including them in an official release ensuring that only mature and implementable constructs are added to the standard.
