- Kent Landfield volunteered to help with documentation.

- Eric suggested that decomposing would be valuable. Implementation of a parser would be good. Eric indicated that he would take a look at JSON re: schema. He has some experience. Assuming an incidence document has been created. Plan of attack. CVRF – and has a proposal of what it should look like. Put a schema on top of that and then a parser on top of that.
- Omar will convert several advisories in JSON format and will post to the GitHub repository.
- Kent will follow up of Dave Waltermire and NVD folks. It would be good to have them involved.
- Eric volunteered to create a JSON schema and suggested that someone should write a parser, but not at the same time.
