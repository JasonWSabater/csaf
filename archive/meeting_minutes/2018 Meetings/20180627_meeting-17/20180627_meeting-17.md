- Participants didn&#39;t have any objections or discussions related to the localization support in schema and items discussed by Eric at the TC email ( [https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/csaf/201806/msg00002.html)](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/csaf/201806/msg00002.html)) .
- One of the items in Jira is the consideration of adding support for Software identification tags (SWID tags): [https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/CSAF-17](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/CSAF-17)
  - Troy suggested the consideration of adding a generic element to the CSAF 2.0 schema that can carry &quot;any tag&quot; (CPE, SWID, or any future specification).
  - Troy will send details and suggestion to the TC email and/or update the Jira issue at: [https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/CSAF-17](https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/CSAF-17)
- Eric reminded the TC about the email from Chet to OASIS and the security recommendations when creating new standards. The original email from Chet can be accessed at: [https://markmail.org/message/ckqq6o3iqaw2be3q](https://markmail.org/message/ckqq6o3iqaw2be3q).
  - Troy mentioned that some of these are just considerations and that should be documented.
  - Eric agreed and commented that at the very least these should be documented.
- Troy suggests to consider addressing how to sign CSAF documents or how to protect integrity and verification. If a CSAF document is shared, how do you validate that it is the same source?
  - Eric agrees that this should be included in the security considerations.
  - Omar will create a JIRA issue to track document integrity validation.
  - Troy: mentioned that when CVRF was originally created, there was a consideration of using the XML signature capabilities for this.
